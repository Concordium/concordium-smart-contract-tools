# This action is triggered when tags of the form releases/vscode-smart-contracts/*.*.*
# are created. It will build cargo-concordium and vscode extension and upload it
# as artifacts of the workflow run. If a release already exists with the given
# tag then the extension will also be attached as assets to the release.
#
# The intended workflow is that a release is created and tagged, at which point
# this action will be triggered and complete the build.
