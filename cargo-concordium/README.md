# Cargo Concordium

`cargo-concordium` is a tool for building and testing smart contracts on the Concordium blockchain.

See [developer documentation](https://developer.concordium.software/en/mainnet/smart-contracts/guides/contract-dev-guides.html)
for guides on how to use the tool in detail.

This crate is a binary, and its versioning applies to the command-line API.
There are no guarantees about internal crate API.

## Creating a new Concordium smart contract project

To start a new Concordium smart contract project, run the command:

```
cargo concordium init
```

This command will generate a new project from the templates in the [template folder](https://github.com/Concordium/concordium-rust-smart-contracts).

## Compiling smart contracts

```
cargo concordium build -e --out contract.wasm.v1
```
will build a contract, embed the schema, and output the artifact to
`contract.wasm.v1`. This can be deployed to the chain or tested locally.

### Compilation options

Since a contract running on the chain will typically not be able to recover from
panics, and error traces are not reported, it is useful not to bloat code size
with them. Setting `panic=abort` will make it so that the compiler will generate
simple `Wasm` traps on any panic that occurs. This option can be specified
either in `.cargo/config` or in the `Cargo.toml` file as

```
[profile.release]
# Don't unwind on panics, just trap.
panic = "abort"
```

The latter will only set this option in `release` builds, for debug builds use

```
[profile.dev]
# Don't unwind on panics, just trap.
panic = "abort"
```
instead.

Note that currently this is the default already for wasm32-unknown-unknown target.

An additional option that might be useful to minimize code size at the cost of
some performance in some cases is
```
[profile.release]
# Tell `rustc` to optimize for small code size.
opt-level = "s"
```
or even `opt-level = "z"`.

In some cases using `opt-level=3` actually leads to smaller code sizes, presumably due to more inlining and dead code removal as a result.

## Locally executing contracts

The following are some example invocations of the `cargo concordium` binary's subcommand `run`.

```shell
cargo concordium run init --context init-context.json --parameter parameter.bin --source ./simple_game.wasm --out state.bin --amount 123
```

with input files

```json
{
    "metadata": {
        "slotNumber": 1,
        "blockHeight": 1,
        "finalizedHeight": 1,
        "slotTime": "2021-01-01T00:00:01Z"
    },
    "initOrigin": "3uxeCZwa3SxbksPWHwXWxCsaPucZdzNaXsRbkztqUUYRo1MnvF"
}
```

and `parameter.bin` as

```
00001111aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

(as a text file without a newline).

```shell
cargo concordium run receive --context receive-context.json --parameter parameter-receive.bin --source ./simple_game.wasm --state state-in.bin --amount 0 --name "receive_help_yourself" --balance 13 --out state-out.bin
```

where an example receive context is

```json
{
    "metadata": {
        "slotNumber": 1,
        "blockHeight": 1,
        "finalizedHeight": 1,
        "slotTime": "2021-01-01T00:00:01Z"
    },
    "invoker": "3uxeCZwa3SxbksPWHwXWxCsaPucZdzNaXsRbkztqUUYRo1MnvF",
    "selfAddress": {"index": 0, "subindex": 0},
    "selfBalance": 0,
    "sender": {
        "type": "Account",
        "address": "3uxeCZwa3SxbksPWHwXWxCsaPucZdzNaXsRbkztqUUYRo1MnvF"
    },
    "owner": "3uxeCZwa3SxbksPWHwXWxCsaPucZdzNaXsRbkztqUUYRo1MnvF"
}
```

See `--help` or `help` option to `cargo concordium run` for an explanation of the options.

## Removing Host Information from Binary

By default the compiled binary from a rust crate contains some information from the host machine, namely rust-related paths such as the path to `.cargo`. This can be seen by inspecting the produced binary:

Lets assume your username is `tom` and you have a smart contract `foo` located in your home folder, which you compiled in release-mode to WASM32.
By running the following command inside the `foo` folder, you will be able to see the paths included in the binary: `strings target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/foo.wasm | grep tom`

To remove the host information, the path prefixes can be remapped using a flag given to the compiler.
`RUSTFLAGS=--remap-path-prefix=/home/tom=secret cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`, where `/home/tom` is the prefix you want to change into `secret`.
The flag can be specified multiple times to remap multiple prefixes.

The flags can also be set permanently in the `.cargo/config` file in your crate, under the `build` section:

``` toml
[build]
rustflags = ["--remap-path-prefix=/home/tom=secret"]
```
